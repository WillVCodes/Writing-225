<h2>"Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the people". Lincoln also said that the just powers of governments come from the consent of the governed. - Abraham Lincoln <br>

“Government's first duty is to protect the people, not ruin their lives”. - Ronald Reagan <br>

“Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right … and a desire to know.”
—John Adams, 1765 <br>
</h2>
<p>The history of American democracy can date back to the 1630’s, amongst non-native Americans in the colonies of New England. They were deemed as democratic because every man that is free had the choice to exercise their right to vote in elections related to laws and for politicians. Now in the modern day, democracy is still at large, as the citizens vote for their elected politicians and laws through the popular vote. However, through the difference of democratic reason found in the electoral college and with the current standing of our supreme court, democracy has taken quite the change since 1630.
