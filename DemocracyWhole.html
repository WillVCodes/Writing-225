<p>“I believe that democracy is based on the ability to make democracy serve the good of the majority of the people. If it can’t do that, then it should not survive.”  - Eleanor Rosevelt<br> Democracy is derived from the Greek term dēmokratia, with  “demos” meaning “people” and “kratos” meaning rule.  As well, Cleisthenes was the founder of democracy itself during the fifth century BCE in Athens. Cleisthenes created a general assembly where all free Athenian men had one vote and could discuss and vote on all aspects of the city. He divided the four tribal groups into ten new groups called phyle, each with a mythological patron. Cleisthenes also based political responsibility off of citizenship and related local councils called demes to organize neighborhoods. Each deme had a local assembly and a leader similar to a mayor. Lastly, in order to keep everything protected, Cleisthenes reformed the Athenian Council so that decisions were not based on family or region.
