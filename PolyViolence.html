<h1  style="color: blue; font-size: 50px;""></b> Political Violence</h1>
<p1><strong> “The very weaknesses of human nature are what make it so important that we keep a constantly watchful eye on our government, and that in turn our government watches us with equal care.”  - Eleanor Rosevelt New York Times 1937<br></p1>
<p2 style="text-indent: 15px;">Political Violence is a side effect of Social Contract theory, the idea that there exists a perpetual state of give and take between an individual and their Government where the individual gives up some rights in exchange for protection from their Government. Political violence fits into this model when the Government overasserts themselves, taking more than they give or when the government gives nothing while still taking from the individual. As one person against an entity, political violence becomes the only way one can be heard and seen. </p2>
