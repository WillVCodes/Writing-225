<p2 style="text-indent: 15px;">Operation Lava-Jato or Operation Car Wash was an investigation into corruption into money laundering in Brazil in 2014 from a small car wash in Brasilia where it was suspected money laundering was happening from. As the investigation went on large corruption and money laundering schemes were uncovered. Brazil’s Federal Police were originally looking into four criminal groups in which they had been sending money back to Brazil without using legitimate international transfer. They had been mixing what they had abroad with money in Brazil. During the investigation they came to find a high luxury car was given by Albert Yousseff, a known money laundering suspect, to Mr. Paolo Costa, former President of Petrobras. Petrobras was Brazil’s biggest company at the time and a major company  in the gas and oil industry. Although Costa no longer worked at Petrobras it was found suspicious Youssef, a known money laundering suspect, would give Costa a brand new car. Since April 2017, the investigation came to more than 40 phases and each time they issued search and arrest warrants. They found more than $2 billion dollars in bribes, and so far $42 million in bribes that pertains only to the Petrobras case. The Petrobras case uncovered a large network of corruption and led to major findings in other cases.
